# AI-Powered Online Boutique Enhancement - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project is designed for the **GKE Turns 10 Hackathon** and transforms the existing Google Cloud Online Boutique microservices demo into a comprehensive AI-powered e-commerce platform using intelligent agents. The enhancement will integrate 13 distinct AI agents that interact with the existing Online Boutique APIs (without modifying core application code) to create a personalized, intelligent shopping experience.

The system leverages Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK), Gemini models with voice/video capabilities, Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol, kubectl-ai, and Gemini CLI to create a developer-friendly, modular architecture. All agents will be deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) as new microservices that communicate with the existing Online Boutique services through their established APIs.

The system will provide advanced features including real-time virtual try-on with body/face analysis, mood-based shopping, dynamic pricing, personalized recommendations, and comprehensive inventory management while maintaining the cloud-native, scalable architecture. The project is designed to be enjoyable to develop with modern tooling, clear separation of concerns, and intuitive agent interactions.
