    <p>
        <strong>A. CHOOSE A CHALLENGE.</strong> To celebrate Google Kubernetes Engine’s (GKE) 10th birthday, this hackathon challenges participants to revolutionize existing microservice applications by integrating cutting-edge agentic AI capabilities, all orchestrated on GKE. Enhance existing microservice applications with cutting-edge agentic AI capabilities, all orchestrated on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). You must choose a provided, pre-existing microservice application, either Bank of Anthos or Online Boutique, as your foundational codebase. Your primary task is to add agentic AI capabilities to this application by interacting with its existing APIs, meaning you will not be modifying the core application code directly, but rather building new components that call into its established APIs.</p>
    <p>Key technologies to be leveraged include:</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Required:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>

        <li>
            <strong>Kubectl-ai:</strong> kubectl-ai acts as an intelligent interface, translating user intent into precise Kubernetes operations, making Kubernetes management more accessible and efficient.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Gemini CLI:</strong> Gemini CLI is a command-line AI workflow tool that connects to your tools, understands your code and accelerates your workflows.</li>

    <h5 id="8-judging">8. JUDGING:</h5>
    <p>On or about the period between September 23, 2025 through October 10, 2025, (“Judging Period”) the Submissions will be evaluated by the Judges in the following Stages. Eligible submissions will be evaluated by a panel of judges selected by the Sponsor (the “Judges”). Judges may be employees of the sponsor or third parties, may or may not be listed individually on the Hackathon Website, and may change before or during the Judging Period. Judging may take place in one or more rounds with one or more panels of Judges, at the discretion of the sponsor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Submissions will be evaluated by the Judges in the following Stages:</p>
    <p>Stage One: The first stage will determine via pass/fail whether the Submission meets a baseline level of viability, in that the Submission includes all Submission requirements, reasonably addresses a Challenge, and reasonably applies the requirements.</p>
    <p>Stage Two: All Submissions that pass Stage One will be evaluated in Stage Two by the Judges based on the following weighted criteria, and according to the sole and absolute discretion of the Judges. Each Submission will receive a score from 1 to 5 per criterion and those criterion scores will be averaged per Submission.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Technical Implementation (40%):</strong> How well is the solution technically executed? Your code should be clean, efficient, and well-documented. How effectively does the project demonstrate proper deployment and interaction of your application and agents on GKE, and their communication via agent frameworks?</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Demo and Presentation (40%):</strong> Is the problem clearly defined, and is the solution effectively presented through a demo and documentation? Your submission must include a text description, an architecture diagram, and a demonstration video (maximum 3 minutes) clearly explaining your project, its features, and how it functions. Have you explained how you used GKE, agent frameworks, and relevant tools? This section should detail your implementation choices and their rationale.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Innovation and Creativity (20%):</strong> How novel and original is the idea? Projects that address a significant problem or create a truly unique solution, going beyond basic AI implementations, will score higher.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Stage Three: The Submissions that pass Stage One and Two will be evaluated based on Bonus Developer Contributions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If the Submission includes a complete and requested optional Developer Contribution of publishing a blog post, podcast, or video, a maximum of 0.4 points will be added. The content must be publicly viewable and not set to “unlisted” on Youtube, etc. You must include language that says you created the piece of content for the purposes of entering this hackathon.</li>
        <li>If the Submission includes a complete and requested optional Developer Contribution of a social media post on X, LinkedIn, Instagram, or Facebook using the hashtag #GKEHackathon, a maximum of 0.4 points will be added.&nbsp;</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Each Submission will receive a Final score from 1 to 5.8, with the highest possible Final score being 5.8.</p>
    <p>The highest-scoring Submission for each region (North America, Latin America, Europe-Middle East-Africa, Asia Pacific) will be selected as the potential winner(s). The highest-scoring Submission across all regions will win the Grand Prize. Ties will be broken by comparing scores on each criterion in the order listed, and if a tie remains, judges will vote. If a potential winner is disqualified, the Submission with the next highest score will become the potential winner. Determinations of judges are final and binding.</p>
    <p>The award of a prize to a potential winner is subject to verification of the identity, qualifications and role of the potential winner in the creation of the Submission. No Submission or individual shall be deemed a winning Submission or winner until their post-competition prize affidavits have been completed and verified, even if prospective winners have been announced verbally or on the competition website. The final decision to designate a winner shall be made by the Sponsor and/or Administrator. A Submission can win a maximum of one prize. In the event that no entries are received for a region, no prize will be awarded.</p>
    <p>On or about October 10, 2025, the potential winner(s) will be selected and may be notified by email, at Sponsor’s discretion for Winner Verification Requirement (as defined below). If a potential winner does not respond to the notification attempt within two days from the first notification attempt, then such potential winner will be disqualified and an alternate potential winner will be selected from among all eligible entries received based on the judging criteria described herein.&nbsp; Except where prohibited by law, each potential winner may be required to sign and return a Declaration of Eligibility and Liability and Publicity Release and provide any additional information that may be required by Sponsor.&nbsp; If required, potential winners must return all such required documents within two days following attempted notification or such potential winner will be deemed to have forfeited the prize and another potential winner will be selected based on the judging criteria described herein. All notification requirements, as well as other requirements within these Rules, will be strictly enforced.</p>
    <p>The public Winner Announcement will take place at KubeCon on or around November 10 - 13, 2025.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“Winner Verification Requirement” means THE AWARD OF A PRIZE TO A POTENTIAL WINNER IS SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION OF THE IDENTITY, QUALIFICATIONS AND ROLE OF THE POTENTIAL WINNER IN THE CREATION OF THE SUBMISSION. No Submission or individual shall be deemed a winning Submission or winner until their post-competition prize affidavits have been completed and verified, even if prospective winners have been announced verbally or on the competition website.
